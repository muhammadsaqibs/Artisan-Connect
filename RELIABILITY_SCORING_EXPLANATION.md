# 🎯 Artisan Connect - Reliability Scoring System Explained

## 📊 **How Our AI-Powered Reliability Score Works**

Our system automatically calculates a **Reliability Score** for every artisan using advanced machine learning algorithms. This score is **100% unbiased** and **completely automated** - no human intervention required!

---

## 🧮 **The Mathematical Formula**

```
Reliability Score = (Completion Rate × 0.4) + (On-Time Rate × 0.3) + (Positive Feedback Rate × 0.3)
```

### **Weight Distribution:**
- **Job Completion Rate**: 40% (Most Important)
- **On-Time Arrival Rate**: 30% (Professionalism)
- **Positive Feedback Rate**: 30% (Customer Satisfaction)

---

## 📈 **How Each Component is Calculated**

### 1. **Job Completion Rate (40% Weight)**
**What it measures:** How many accepted jobs the artisan actually completes

**Calculation:**
```
Completion Rate = (Completed Jobs ÷ Total Accepted Jobs) × 100
```

**Status Categories:**
- ✅ **Completed**: Job finished successfully
- ⚠️ **Partially Completed**: Job partially done
- ❌ **Not Completed**: Job not finished

**Example:** If Ali accepts 10 jobs and completes 9, his completion rate = (9÷10) × 100 = 90%

---

### 2. **On-Time Arrival Rate (30% Weight)**
**What it measures:** How punctual the artisan is

**Calculation:**
```
On-Time Rate = (On-Time Arrivals ÷ Total Completed Jobs) × 100
```

**Timing Logic:**
- ✅ **On Time**: Arrives within ±5 minutes of scheduled time
- ⚠️ **Late**: 5-30 minutes delay
- ❌ **Missed**: More than 30 minutes delay or no arrival

**Example:** If Ali completes 9 jobs and arrives on time for 8, his on-time rate = (8÷9) × 100 = 89%

---

### 3. **Positive Feedback Rate (30% Weight)**
**What it measures:** Customer satisfaction with the work quality

**Calculation:**
```
Positive Feedback Rate = (Positive Reviews ÷ Total Completed Jobs) × 100
```

**Rating Categories:**
- ✅ **Positive**: 4-5 star ratings
- ⚠️ **Neutral**: 3 star ratings
- ❌ **Negative**: 1-2 star ratings

**Example:** If Ali gets 7 positive reviews out of 9 completed jobs, his feedback rate = (7÷9) × 100 = 78%

---

## 🎯 **Real-World Example**

**Ali Khan (Plumber) - Last Week Performance:**

| Metric | Value | Weight | Points |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Job Completion Rate | 90% | 40% | 36 points |
| On-Time Arrival Rate | 89% | 30% | 26.7 points |
| Positive Feedback Rate | 78% | 30% | 23.4 points |
| **Total Reliability Score** | | | **86.1%** |

**Result:** Ali's Reliability Score = 86% (Excellent!)

## 🤖 **AI & Machine Learning Features**

### **Linear Regression Prediction**
Our system uses machine learning to predict future reliability trends:

```javascript
// Simplified ML prediction
const predictedScore = (currentScore * 0.7) + (trendFactor * 0.3)
```

### **Weighted Graph Analysis**
- Analyzes patterns across multiple jobs
- Identifies improvement trends
- Predicts potential issues

### **Auto-Updates**
- Score recalculates after every completed job
- Real-time updates in admin dashboard
- Historical trend tracking

---

## 🔄 **How the System Updates Automatically**

### **When a Job is Completed:**
1. System determines completion status
2. Calculates arrival timing
3. Waits for customer feedback
4. Recalculates all three rates
5. Updates final reliability score
6. Stores in database with timestamp

### **Admin Verification Process:**
- Admins can verify job data accuracy
- Flag incorrect completion/timing data
- System maintains audit trail
- **No manual score assignment allowed**
