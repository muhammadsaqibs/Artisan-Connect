# Provider Booking Flow Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the improved provider signup, verification, and booking flow for Artisan Connect.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Sign-Up Form (`SignupPage.jsx`)

**Before:** Simple dropdown for role selection  
**After:** Visual toggle buttons with clear distinction

**Features:**
- Two prominent buttons: "Book Services" (Customer) and "Provide Services" (Provider)
- Visual feedback with indigo highlight for selected role
- Helper text: "✓ Fill out your profile and start earning!" when Provider is selected
- Better UX with larger clickable areas

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/SignupPage.jsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Provider Onboarding Flow

**Existing Flow:**
1. User signs up as Provider → redirected to `/provider-onboarding`
2. User fills out profile with category, rates, skills, documents
3. Profile saved to database with `status: 'pending'`
4. Admin can review and verify the provider

**What Works:**
- Profile submission stores to admin panel automatically
- Admin can verify/unverify providers
- Provider profile linked to User account

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/ProviderOnboarding.jsx`

---

### 3. ✅ New Provider Booking Page (`ProviderBookingPage.jsx`)

**Purpose:** Replace cart-based booking with dedicated booking page

**Features:**
- **Provider Profile Display:**
  - Avatar, name, category/subcategory
  - Hourly rate and reliability score
  - Rating and number of reviews
  - Bio

- **Booking Form:**
  - Preferred date & time picker
  - Location fields (city, area, full address)
  - Optional latitude/longitude
  - Additional notes field
  - Estimated cost display

- **Payment Integration:**
  - Creates ServiceRequest in backend
  - Uses existing payment flow
  - Shows booking fee + estimated hours

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/ProviderBookingPage.jsx`  
**Route:** `/book-provider/:id`

---

### 4. ✅ Updated Providers Page (`ProvidersPage.jsx`)

**Before:** "Hire" button added provider to cart via `bookNow()`  
**After:** "Hire" button navigates to booking page

**Changes:**
- Removed `bookNow` cart integration
- Added `useNavigate` import
- Button now navigates to `/book-provider/:id`
- Added hover effect for better UX

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/ProvidersPage.jsx`

---

### 5. ✅ Admin Verification System

**Existing System:**
- Admin fetches all providers from `/api/providers`
- Shows verification status (pending/verified/unverified)
- Can verify/unverify providers with CheckCircle/XCircle buttons

**Additional Endpoint:**
- Fetches from `/api/admin/providers` for provider user management
- Supports account suspension/activation

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`
