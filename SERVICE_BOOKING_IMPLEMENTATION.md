## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Booking Flow:
1. Customer visits `/providers` page
2. Clicks "Book This Service" on ServiceBookingCard
3. Fills professional booking form
4. Submits booking â†’ Creates Booking record in database
5. Booking appears in customer's service history
6. Provider can update booking status
7. System automatically calculates reliability score when job completes

### Reliability Score Formula:
```
Score = (Completion Rate Ã— 0.40) + (On-Time Rate Ã— 0.30) + (Positive Feedback Rate Ã— 0.30)
```

### Example Calculation:
- Ali Khan (Plumber):
  - 9/10 jobs completed = 90% completion rate
  - 8/9 jobs on-time = 89% on-time rate  
  - 7/9 positive feedback = 78% feedback rate
  - **Final Score**: (90Ã—0.40) + (89Ã—0.30) + (78Ã—0.30) = 86.1 â†’ **86**
